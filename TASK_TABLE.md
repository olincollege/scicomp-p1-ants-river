# Task table
The planned timeline for this project:

| **Task name**| **Description**| **Computing skill** | **Assigned to** | **Due date**| **Due date justification**|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rough architecture        | Get a high-level idea of the data structures and code flow I plan to use. A first pass to discover where the complexity might be. Written in pseudocode. | Software planning   | Me              | End of class 1/27 | This should be a 1-2 hour process involving referencing the paper and not too much deep diving on specific functionality.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Python architecture       | Translate the data structures and code layout from the rough architecture into Python.                                                                   | Software planning   | Me              | Before class 1/30 | This should be relatively small, but I'd expect to run into one or two snags, so there's somewhat high variability here.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Mechanical implementation | Write the actual model code/action rules into the previously made structure, and write tests for that code. No interface required yet.                   | Algorithm design    | Me              | Before class 2/3  | I absolutely want to have full, test-covered model code done by the code conversation class. If I'm lucky, this will go smoothly and finish early, which would allow me to have the baseline interface to be ready then as well.                                                                    |
| Baseline interface        | A minimum-viable interface, likely in the command line. Quick to develop but not necessarily easy to use.                                                | UX design           | Me              | Before class 2/6  | This should be reasonably quick, and if things go well it might be done as soon as 2/3, but at the worst it needs to be done by 2/6. Also, there's a chance I skip this step and jump straight to the GUI if I realize during development that it won't be useful.                                  |
| Polished interface        | A high-quality, intuitive graphical user interface. No technical skill should be required to use it.                                                     | UX design           | Me              | Evening of 2/9    | This is the last functionality task, and after I reach a functional interface I can be flexible in how much time I spend on interface polish and additional features, depending on my availability. I'm ending it on the night of 2/9 so that no matter what I have a little time for code cleanup. |
| Code polishing            | With extra time, clean up code structure for understandability and maintainability.                                                                      | Software longevity  | Me              | Before class 2/10 | In all likelihood this will be ongoing throughout the project, but I want to have a little time dedicated to it.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
